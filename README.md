## Dependencies for Running Locally
1. cmake >= 2.8
 * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)

2. make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
 * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
 * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
 * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

3. OpenCV >= 4.1
 * All OSes: refer to the [official instructions](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d65/tutorial_table_of_content_introduction.html)
 * This must be compiled from source using the `-D OPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON` cmake flag for testing the SIFT and SURF detectors. If using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `$> brew install --build-from-source opencv` will install required dependencies and compile opencv with the `opencv_contrib` module by default (no need to set `-DOPENCV_ENABLE_NONFREE=ON` manually). 
 * The OpenCV 4.1.0 source code can be found [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.1.0)

4. gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using either [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php/start) or [Microsoft's VCPKG, a C++ package manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/install-vcpkg?view=msvc-160&tabs=windows). VCPKG maintains its own binary distributions of OpenCV and many other packages. To see what packages are available, type `vcpkg search` at the command prompt. For example, once you've _VCPKG_ installed, you can install _OpenCV 4.1_ with the command:
```bash
c:\vcpkg> vcpkg install opencv4[nonfree,contrib]:x64-windows
```
Then, add *C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\bin* and *C:\vcpkg\installed\x64-windows\debug\bin* to your user's _PATH_ variable. Also, set the _CMake Toolchain File_ to *c:\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake*.


## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: with specifying path and bVis arguments. path is the path to the image folder. The bVis takes 3 values true = slower option with cv showing the kypoint matches. false = faster options without showing the cv imshow window. avg will output average values for the total time taken and keypoint matches. The detailed description is given below in section @@@.   
 `./2D_feature_tracking path bVis`.  
 ` path = path to image folder`  
 ` bVis = true , false , avg `
